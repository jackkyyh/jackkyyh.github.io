I am a first-year PhD student at QICI, University of Hong Kong. I’m fortunate to be advised by [Giulio Chiribella](https://qici.weebly.com/giulio-chiribella.html). I completed a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at HKUST, with a minor degree in physics. My research interests are quantum machine learning and quantum error correction.
